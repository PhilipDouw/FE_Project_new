# FE Project - UZH
## VIX Construction and Error Analysis
### Winter 2019
#### Zhiwei Cheng, David Diserens, Philip Douw

This Github groups all the codes and more that we used throughout our project.
-	“BS” folder: Regroups the codes used for computations with the Black & Scholes model. (These scripts and functions where coded by our team)

-	“Bates” folder: Regroups the codes used for computations with the Bates model. Note that we could not run some of these codes since generate one option list takes about 1 hour with our set up and to compute for example the “GraphsBates” script, we would need to generate about 180 option lists, which was not feasible in our opinion. (These scripts and functions where coded by our team)

-	“Correlation” folder: script and data used for to calculate the historical correlation between the VIX and  S&P 500 indexes using data retrieved from Yahoo finance. (These scripts and functions where coded by our team)

-	“Real Data” folder: Used to calculate the VIX using real data. (Not all scripts and functions were coded by us)

-	“smooth_NEW – call, smooth_NEW – put & smooth_NEW – Original” folders: Regroups the scripts, functions and data for the attempt of smoothing the implied volatility using option data generated by our Bates functions. (scripts and codes retrieved online and slightly modified to be able to use for our project)

Thank you and have fun!
